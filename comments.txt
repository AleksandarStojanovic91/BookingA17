This is insanity, never done before in the history of this platform. Hats off to you Jimmy 
Huge props to the set designers, everything was spot on!
This man went from playing Minecraft to giving away millions to people.  Props to you Jimmy 
The best content, benefiting many people, thank you @MrBeast
greetings from Indonesian🇮🇩
Huge props jimmy for all the work you do
Can't wait for a Squid Game 2 this was perfect!
The sets in this are INCREDIBLE. Would love to know more about the team that designed and built them!
Jimmy’s Japanese VA is none other than Naruto himself  !
Can't believe it's already been one year since this madman did it. Kudos
Wow! What an intense game! Great job MrBeast!
I love people who made it look so dramatic when they got eliminated. It really gives the right vibes
I'm just always amazed at how kind and giving you are. Love to see people. Still care about other people 
Can we just take a moment to appreciate how much time and work gets put into these videos.  Good job MrBeast.
I can't be the only one who would just run across the glass bridge if given the chance. One step per platform is definitely possible, and would actually bypass the challenge in Squid Game too. The way pressure causes glass to fracture depends on the angle, so a diagonal entry would give your foot enough time to press off- shattering it, but letting you continue. This would also tell the other contestants exactly where to go.
This man is a walking legend, respect to you Jimmy
We all appreciate the difficulty of the content that MR BEAST brings to us
This was insane!! Congrats to homie who won! GGs!
No YouTuber has come close to this madness. Great job jimmy!!
My daughters and nephews in love with your games greetings from Mozambique - Africa. All subscribed
더빙 진짜 자연스럽게 잘됐다 워낙 영상이 빠르게 진행되니까 자막 보다보면 화면을 잘 못 보게 되고 좀 정신없는데, 더빙으로 보니까 이해도 빠르고 더 몰입감 있음
I can't believe it's been 2 years since he did all this, MrBeast is legendary man
this is next level insanity!! you are a genius Jimmy
Incredible job putting this together, Jimmy! So much work and detail went into making this happen @@@@@@
Well done MrBeast you are an inspiration, everything was well organized
I know it's been said a lot it's just crazy how jimmy just gives people chances to change their whole lives
This is on another scale it’s amazing
LOL Imagine if 456 actually ended up winning it, he was REALLY CLOSE!
This challenge was so good that someone made a spinoff of it on Netflix. Well done
I think its safe to say that Mr.beast is probably the  best content creator on the platform right now. Good on him for doing all that the does.
Videoların harika sen harikasın seni yeni keşfettim videoları biraz geriden izliyorum o yüzden 
This dude went from playing Minecraft to Being hunted by the army to giving $1m+ to people for literally participating in his challenges
The sets in this are really Incredible. I am Speechless over how executed it was.Definitely worth the hype!
I swear if only jimmy has his own TV game show, it will be massive!
I genuinely can't get over the quality of the sets. Wow.
What a life this man's living, while helping
Those, in need help. Kudos.
Loved this episode! Wish I could have spent time with my brother watching it. He would have loved the real show and this. RIP John. Miss you brother.
This is just incredible! 
First one of these long ones I've watched.  Insane.  That he thinks up all this stuff, and then makes it all happen, is impressive.
This is just ONE of the reasons people love Mrbeast because he brings fantasy to reality
平和的なイカゲームでめっちゃ面白い(=^▽^=) 
絶対に参加者楽しんでるのがわかる笑
He's got more budget that the original producers.
Já tô esperando meus 10ml. Novo escrito no canal achei muito legal da sua parte ajudar as pessoas dessa forma 
One word... INCREDIBLE
I was extremely impressed with how quickly you made this happen my hat off to you and your team jimmy
This guy's puts so much hard work into his videos congrats to him. He's a positive lifechanger giving away $400,000 that's a lot of money I love him. He's an inspiration
This man is unreal 
This is INSANE!! It's an absolute masterpiece!! Keep up the great work, MrBeast!
El momento mas jodidamente épico del 2021.
This version of the game is pretty much what the contestants of the show were probably expecting.
Muy alegre por el ganador. Me encantó que dijera que le dará una parte a su mami ️
Cada vez que veo este programa me emociona como si yo estuviera participando, quisiera poder algún día poder tener la oportunidad de participar en unos de tus vídeos
You guys need to make another one for sure!
i am usually late to the hype. i was never a mrbeast fan but upon watching squid games recently, i must say this production shows an amazing amount of dedication, there is definitely something about this fellow
Wow, that was insane! Absolutely amazing 
i didn’t expect the map to actually look THIS good, i was just amazed and the fact that the platform game actually look to size was awesome
Mi hijo queriendo animarme (por el fallecimiento de mi marido), me enseñó tus videos... Es que no pensé que sería así! Espetacular, emocionante!
Tus videos alegran mis días!
Gracias Mr Beast!
That Japanese voice for MrBeast, yeah that's definitely Naruto.
Just came here to see Mr beast dubbed in Japanese by Naruto VA xD
La verdad muy bien echo! Esto nunca se vio en un reto.. muchas felicidades. Saludos desde Argentina -Salta Capital ️
Thanks jimmy, for so much training what do you give us.
I'm speechless over how well executed this was. They were spot on with EVERYTHING!
こういうことをすることができる事態がめちゃくちゃ凄い
Heard you on Joe Rogan, you are truly a Beast!  Congrats to your success, you rock!
its funny that in the glass bridge stage, the people who haven't taken a risk were the ones yelling at the people in front to move lol
いろんな言語に対応してるのマジありがたすぎる。声優も豪華だし
세트장 진짜 잘 만드셨다
Un juego bueno bien recreado me a gustado.
Si pudieses recrear algo parecido a locos a por el oro tambien estaria buena
Honestly, this is the best retaliation against Netflix I seen ever. Hats off to Jimmy.
You did a really good job, I wish I could be there
Permainan yang menyenangkan tapi ada haru disitu, selamat kepada pemenang dan jangan sedih kepada yang kalah. tetap tenang dan sehat selalu untuk kita semua
I would’ve preferred a plastic knife fight for the final game, but I guess musical chairs work. 
The man who sacrificed for player 456 deserves respect.
Lmao they did a pretty good job with the korean and japanese dubs. Love it.
this man is a genius and he is also so kind
love your videos. my whole family loves watching your videos!
와 대박
역시 beast형이야!
한국인으로서 모든 게임을 드라마에 나온 그대로 표현했다고 생각합니다. 퀄리티 대박!!
Que humildad mr beast
456 literally used his plot armor so well, sad he had to get disqualified..
Would be cool to see Mrbeast show up in s2 of squid games lol
give this man a statue already!!!
These games always seem fun tbh even if it wasn't for money
I love how, me being a fencer, they used fencing masks with spray-painted designs for the guard masks. Well done. :>
It's the fact that hes generous enough to create these amazing concepts and sets, for RANDOM people.  all hats off to you Jimmy, you really killed it on this one!
Props to you Jimmy for editing all the smoke in. That was an amazing job no sarcasam
Watching this with Japanese Audio is a trip 

Naruto is hosting the Squid Game every 
mr.beast voice dubbed in japanese really is naruto, damn
Mi gran pregunta es porque mr beast tiene la voz de Naruto en Japonés jajajajaja
OMG this IS actually perfect
Amazing job jimmy
MrBeast is the biggest legend to ever exist on this platform.
This is great lmaohad so much fun watching it
MrBeast, вы каким то образом добрались до меня,  я такой контент не смотрю, но вы молодец, ещё вы сделали перевод вообще круто, молодцы, я пересмотрел несколько раз ваши видео на русском, хотелось бы ещё, а так я восторге от вас так как вы знаете и умеете делать контент, продолжайте в том же духе!
Awesome job guys.
The guy sacrificing himself in the pearls game for his best friend has my heart!!
Jimmy’s Japanese va is none other than Naruto himself ️
Dang they actually put a ton of effort into this. Definitely worth the hype!
Props to the cameraman, he’s now a legend for filming this
The amount of effort put into this is uncountable.
Finally Ali win squidgame in reallife 
Me encanta, no me canso de verlo 
솔직히 남도형님 목소리가 잘 붙는다 지미 성격이 느껴지는
The accuracy, effort and budget put into this is amazing , Jimmy way too goated he deserves everything going his way
A year later and it's still a banger
That glass bridge actually looked high up.
I love these low income channels, they're so creative.
keep on making amazing videos MrBeast
Bacán brother por su programa saludos desde las Islas Galápagos 🇪🇨
I am genuinely surprised at this point that they haven't given Mr.B his own show....he obviously cares about making great content and entertaining the audience all the while also donating large amounts of money to charities and contributing to cleaning oceans and planting new forests.
Crazy how jimmy got Naruto’s voice actor for Japanese dub
Kudos! Loved it!
That's was really fun..man i was supporting 456 
The fact that the Japanese VA is Naruto is hilarious
Jimmy: "no stopping or hovering"

The guy who wins: continues to stop and hover on the chair
Yet another example of how Jimmy will forever be remembered as one of the greatest YouTubers of all time.
This must have taken so long this looks so good
Felt the thrill as much as in the  "Squid game" movie. Sweats, shooh!
남도형 더빙 정말 찰떡이네 ㅎㅎ
супер,всегда мечтал в этом поучаствовать!
Bro the japanese version of mrbeast was so 
The effort that MrBeast put into this is absolutely devious, great job
